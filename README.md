Alright, so this is where my final project for #FEWD16 likes to live, it's appropriately called "The Melbourne Journal and is meant to show:

1. Commonly used CSS features such as:

    1. Ability to use fonts.google.com
    2. Ability to create a layout
    3. Ability to showcase different CSS properties and proper use.
    4. Javascript - APIs (Weather)
    5. Design principles and readable code.
