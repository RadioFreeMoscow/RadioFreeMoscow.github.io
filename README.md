Alright, so this is where my final project for #FEWD16 likes to love, it's appropriately called "The Melbourne Journal and is meant to show:

1. Commonly used CSS features such as:
    Ability to use fonts.google.com
    Ability to create a layout
    Ability to showcase different CSS properties and colourings using the transform property
    Javascript - APIs (Weather)
    Design princicples and readable code.
