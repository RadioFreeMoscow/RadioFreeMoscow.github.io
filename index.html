  <section class="stories">Eric flipped through an unmarked plastic pamphlet, chewing on his lip. It was Russ, the damn machine wasn’t working correctly again. This was the third time this year and each time had cost him an entire production day to factory reset the thing. Russ sat across from him, its legs pressed together, back perfectly straight, and hands kept to its lap.

  <section class="stories">And now I want to tell you about my late Uncle Alex. He was my father’s kid brother, a childless graduate of Harvard who was an honest life insurance salesman in Indianapolis. He was well-read and wise. And his principal complaint about other human beings was that they so seldom noticed it when they were happy. So when we were drinking lemonade under an apple tree in the summer, say, and talking lazily about this and that, almost buzzing like honeybees, Uncle Alex would suddenly interrupt the agreeable blather to exclaim, If this isn’t nice, I don’t know what is. So I do the same now, and so do my kids and grandkids. And I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, If this isn’t nice, I don’t know what is.

    What if JFK and Lee Harvey Oswalds had been really good friends, and the assassination was just a prank that got out of hand? Wouldn't that be, like a little weird.  Well no weirder than Superman landing in the Ukraine and being picked up by the 1930's local party boss, Nikita Khrushchev. Just think of all the corn he could of planted. Did no one ever think it was weird that Joseph Stalin and Superman had the same nom de guerre "Man of Steel"?
